# Unity-Fire-Spreading-Simulation

This is a fairly simple simulation of a fire spreading through a randomly generated population of plants. In its current state, buttons on the UI allow users to generate a random collection of plants, clear the screen, light a random selection of the existing plants, as well as playing and pausing the simulation.

Sliders on the screen allow users to control windspeed, the maximum time for which a plant will burn before becoming "burnt" and the intensity with which fire will be spread through the population.

In addition to the UI elements, there is a 3D dial that allows users to control wind direction.

# TODO:
  Mode selection button isn't fully functional. Different modes should allow users to add, remove, or toggle plants between burning and healthy. Currently only the mode UI is functional, not the actual game logic.
  
  Rather than generating plants all as rectangles of the same size, generate plants from a pool of random shapes
  
  Implemet logic to stop plans from generating on top of one another
  
  Implement a slider to control the number of plants generated when the generate button is clicked
